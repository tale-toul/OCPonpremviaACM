## Introduction

This documents is specific for deploying components in the [demo.redhat.com](https://demo.redhat.com) platform.

This project provides instructions on how to install a Management cluster using vsphere IPI method, in both a connected and disconnected environments.

There is a section on the creation and use of Infra nodes.

The installation and configuration of the mirror registry is explained for the case of the disconnected environment installation. 

The de ployment of managed OCP clusters through ACM "on premisses" has its own section

## Deploying OCP using vSpere IPI on a Connected Environment 

Create a **VMware Cloud Public Cloud Open Environment** in [demo.redhat.com](https://demo.redhat.com). 

![VMWare Cloud Public Open Env Provisioning](images/image14.png)

The environment will be used to deploy an IPI OCP 4.14 cluster hub cluster.

Make sure to enable DNS records creation for OCP. when ordering the environment

![Enable DNS records for OCP](images/image23.png)

It takes about 20 minutes for the environment to be provisioned and ready.
When the environment is ready, an email is received with information on how to access and use it.

Ssh into the bastion node and verify the DNS records for the cluster.  The IPs associated with the API and wildcard \*.apps are public, but they are NATed to internal private IPs in the environment, this is specified in the email received from RHDP:

```
$ dig +short api.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com
3.223.59.140
$ dig +short *.apps.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com
34.198.235.139
```
Get the installer, oc client and pull secret from [the Red Hat Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) and copy them to the bastion host. 

Uncompress the tar files and put them in the running path:

```
$ scp ~/Descargas/openshift-* /home/jjerezro/Descargas/pull-secret.txt   \
  lab-user@bastion-glnm2.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com

$ tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
README.md
oc
kubectl

$ tar xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
README.md
openshift-install

$ sudo cp -vi openshift-install oc /usr/local/bin
'openshift-install' -> '/usr/local/bin/openshift-install'
'oc' -> '/usr/local/bin/oc'
```

Create an ssh key pair.

```
$ ssh localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:AIOgCA9BvbsRJN9NSt0jqJ6xEd4pjlcqyHPwF9aLr3Q.

Download the vCenterâ€™s root CA certificates.  Go to the vCenter's base URL, for example **https://portal.vc.opentlc.com/** Click on the link **Download trusted root CA certificates** on the right side of the web page

![vCenter root CA certificates 2](images/image38.png)

Copy the downloaded file to the bastion host and extract the compressed file:

```
$ scp download.zip lab-user@bastion-6lzvs.6lzvs.dynamic.opentlc.com:
lab-user@bastion-6lzvs.6lzvs.dynamic.opentlc.com's password:

Update the bastion's system trust so the vCenter root CA certificates are recognized as valid:

```
$ sudo cp -vi certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
'certs/lin/02265526.0' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/02265526.0'
'certs/lin/2835d715.0' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/2835d715.0'
...

$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

Create the install-config.yaml file. 

This repository contains a reference install-config.yaml file for a connected vSphere IPI installation at **IPI/Orig-install-config.yaml**

To create the initial configuration file use the following command.  The information required is in the email from RHDP.  For the VIP for API and Ingress use the NAT IP described in the email. The cluster name is the GUID described in the same email.

```

## Infra Nodes During Cluster Deployment

[Infra](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5034771) nodes can be used to isolate infrastructure workloads for two primary purposes:

   1. To prevent incurring billing costs against subscription counts.
   1. To separate maintenance and management.

Infra nodes can be created during cluster deployment or post cluster deployment. 

To have infra nodes created at cluster deployment, start by creating the manifests from the install-config.yaml file.

```
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir glnm2/
INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
INFO Manifests created in: glnm2/manifests and glnm2/openshift
```

One of the manifests defines the worker machineset
```
$ ls glnm2/openshift/*machineset*
glnm2/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-0.yaml
```
### Adding An Infra Machine Set

In this example a new machineset for infra nodes is created, resulting in 2 machinesets: one for workers and one for infra. See later for an example in which the worker machineset is replaced by an infra machineset.

Copy the worker machineset as the infra machineset

```
$ cd glnm2/openshift/

$ cp 99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-0.yaml \
  99_openshift-cluster-api_infra-machineset-0.yaml
```
Modify the infra machineset according to the [documentation.](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html#machineset-yaml-vsphere_creating-infrastructure-machinesets)  Replace all references to worker and put infra instead.

The amount of disk, CPU, and memory resources can be specified in the machineset definition. Keep the original value for **userDataSecret** referencing the worker user data

The final result looks like this:

```
The resulting cluster has 3 worker and 3 infra nodes, but the infra services are running on the worker nodes because those infra services donâ€™t have the matching tolerations to run on the infra nodes.  This must be taken into account if the cluster does not have any worker nodes.

### Replacing The Worker Machine Set

In case of a cluster in which no worker nodes are needed because only infra workloads are going to be executed, replace the worker machineset by an infra machineset and leave the taint out of the infra nodes.

After creating the manifests as described in section [Adding An Infra Machine Set](#adding-an-infra-machine-set), rename the file defining the worker machineset and edit it.    Keep the original value for **userDataSecret** referencing the worker user data.

The machineset definition does not contain any [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).  If there were any taints with the NoSchedule or NoExecute effect, the installation would not complete successfully because the infrastructure worloads created during installation don't have the corresponding tolerations.  The tainst are not needed because this cluster does not have any worker nodes and therefore no user workloads are expected here.
