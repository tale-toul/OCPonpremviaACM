## Introduction

This documents is specific for deploying components in the demo.redhat.com platform.

This project details how to install a Management cluster using vsphere IPI method, in both a connected and disconnected environment.

There is a section on the creation and use of Infra nodes.

The installation and configuration of the mirror registry is explained for the case of the disconnected environment installation. 

The de ployment of managed OCP clusters through ACM "on premisses" has its own section

## Deploying OCP using vSpere IPI on a Connected Environment 

Create 1 **VMware Cloud Public Cloud Open Environment** in demo.redhat.com. 

![VMWare Cloud Public Open Env Provisioning](images/image14.png)

The environment will be used to deploy an IPI OCP 4.14 cluster hub cluster.

Make sure to enable DNS records creation for OCP. when ordering the environment

![Enable DNS records for OCP](images/image23.png)

It takes about 20 minutes for the environment to be provisioned and ready.
When the environment is ready, an email is received with information on how to access it.

Ssh into the bastion node and verify the DNS records for the cluster:

```
$ dig +short api.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com
3.223.59.140
$ dig +short *.apps.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com
34.198.235.139
```
Get the installer, oc client and pull secret from [the Red Hat Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) and copy them to the bastion host. 

Uncompress the tar files and put them in the running path:

```
$ scp ~/Descargas/openshift-* /home/jjerezro/Descargas/pull-secret.txt   \
  lab-user@bastion-glnm2.glnm2.dynamic.opentlc.com

$ tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
README.md
oc
kubectl

$ tar xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
README.md
openshift-install

$ sudo cp -vi openshift-install oc /usr/local/bin
'openshift-install' -> '/usr/local/bin/openshift-install'
'oc' -> '/usr/local/bin/oc'
```

Create an ssh key pair.

```
$ ssh localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:AIOgCA9BvbsRJN9NSt0jqJ6xEd4pjlcqyHPwF9aLr3Q.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

```

Download the vCenterâ€™s root CA certificates.  Go to the vCenter's base URL, for example **https://portal.vc.opentlc.com/** Click on the link **Download trusted root CA certificates** on the right side of the web page

![vCenter root CA certificates](images/image18.png)

![vCenter root CA certificates 2](images/image38.png)

Copy the downloaded file to the bastion host and extract the compressed file:

```
$ unzip download.zip
Archive:  download.zip
  inflating: certs/lin/7255df92.0    
  inflating: certs/mac/7255df92.0    
  inflating: certs/win/7255df92.0.crt  
  inflating: certs/lin/75c43eb5.r0   
  inflating: certs/mac/75c43eb5.r0   
  inflating: certs/win/75c43eb5.r0.crl
...
```

Update the bastion's system trust so the vCenter root CA certificates are recognized as valid:

```
$ sudo cp -vi certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
'certs/lin/02265526.0' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/02265526.0'
'certs/lin/2835d715.0' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/2835d715.0'
...

$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

Create the install-config.yaml file.  
This repository contains a reference install-config.yaml file for a connected vSphere IPI installation at **IPI/Orig-install-config.yaml**

To create the initial configuration file use the command the following command.  The information required is in the email from RHDP.  For the VIP for API and Ingress use the NAT IP described in the email.

```

Create a directory with the name of the cluster in the bastion host and copy the install-config.yaml file there:
```
$ mkdir glnm2
$ cp install-config.yaml glnm2/

Run the installer
```
$ openshift-install create cluster --dir glnm2/

If this is a disconnected installation, follow the instructions in section Mirror Registry to install the local registry and mirror the installation images.
